name: Global Commenting
description: Write appropriate code comments that enhance understanding without cluttering the codebase. Use this skill when adding comments to explain complex logic, documenting public APIs, or deciding whether a comment is necessary. Apply across all code files when determining comment necessity and quality. Essential for writing self-documenting code through clear naming, adding minimal but helpful comments for complex logic, avoiding comments about temporary changes or fixes, ensuring comments are evergreen and remain relevant over time, and preferring clear code structure over excessive commenting.
