name: Frontend Components
description: Design and build reusable UI components with clean interfaces and proper composition. Use this skill when creating new components, refactoring existing ones, or designing component APIs. Apply when working on files like components/*.tsx, ui/*.tsx, *.jsx, *.vue, or any component-based frontend code. Essential for implementing single responsibility principle, designing reusable components with configurable props, building composable UI from smaller components, defining clear prop interfaces with TypeScript types, managing component state appropriately, using consistent naming conventions, and documenting component usage with examples.
---

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new React, Vue, or Angular components
- When editing files in `/components/`, `/ui/`, or similar directories
- When defining component props and their TypeScript types
- When refactoring large components into smaller, reusable pieces
- When deciding where to manage state (local vs lifted vs global)
- When designing component APIs and prop interfaces
- When building complex UIs by composing smaller components
- When naming components and their props consistently
- When documenting component usage and examples
- When implementing shared UI primitives (buttons, inputs, cards)
- When evaluating if a component has too many responsibilities
