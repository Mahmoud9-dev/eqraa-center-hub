name: Backend Migrations
description: Write database migration scripts that safely alter database schema and structure. Use this skill when creating migration files, modifying database tables, adding or removing columns, creating indexes, or managing database schema changes. Apply when working on files like migrations/*.ts, db/migrate/*, schema.prisma, or any database migration scripts. Essential for implementing reversible migrations with rollback methods, managing zero-downtime deployments, handling index creation, separating schema from data migrations, and following version control practices for database changes.
