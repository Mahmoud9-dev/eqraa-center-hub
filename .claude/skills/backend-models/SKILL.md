name: Backend Models
description: Define database models and entity schemas with proper relationships, constraints, and data types. Use this skill when creating or modifying model definitions, entity classes, or database schemas. Apply when working on files like models/*.ts, entities/*.ts, schema.prisma, or any ORM model definitions. Essential for implementing proper naming conventions, timestamps (createdAt/updatedAt), data integrity constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, foreign keys), relationship definitions (hasMany, belongsTo, manyToMany), indexes on foreign keys, and model-level validations.
---

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new database model or entity files
- When defining relationships between models (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- When adding database constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- When defining foreign key relationships and cascade behaviors
- When choosing appropriate data types for columns
- When adding timestamps or audit fields to models
- When implementing model-level validations
- When working on files in `/models/`, `/entities/`, or `/prisma/` directories
- When indexing columns for query performance
- When balancing normalization with query performance needs
