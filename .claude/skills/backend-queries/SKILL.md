name: Backend Queries
description: Write secure and performant database queries using ORMs or raw SQL. Use this skill when writing database queries, implementing data access logic, or optimizing query performance. Apply when working on files like repositories/*.ts, queries/*.ts, services/*.ts with database operations, or any code that interacts with the database. Essential for preventing SQL injection with parameterized queries, avoiding N+1 query problems with eager loading, selecting only needed columns, using transactions for related operations, implementing query timeouts, and caching expensive queries.
---

## When to use this skill:

- When writing database queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- When using ORM methods like findMany, findUnique, create, update
- When implementing repository or data access layer patterns
- When optimizing slow database queries
- When fixing N+1 query problems with eager loading or joins
- When wrapping related database operations in transactions
- When adding query caching for expensive operations
- When writing raw SQL queries with parameterized inputs
- When adding indexes for frequently queried columns
- When implementing query timeouts for long-running operations
- When working on files in `/repositories/`, `/queries/`, or data access layers
