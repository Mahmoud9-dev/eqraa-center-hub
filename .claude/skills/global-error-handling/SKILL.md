name: Global Error Handling
description: Implement robust error handling patterns that provide clear feedback and maintain system stability. Use this skill when adding try-catch blocks, creating error boundaries, handling API failures, or implementing retry logic. Apply when working on any code that can fail including API calls, file operations, database queries, or user input processing. Essential for showing user-friendly error messages, failing fast with clear errors, using specific exception types, centralizing error handling at appropriate boundaries, implementing graceful degradation, adding retry strategies with exponential backoff, and properly cleaning up resources.

## When to use this skill:

- When adding try-catch blocks around potentially failing code
- When handling API response errors and network failures
- When implementing error boundaries in React applications
- When deciding on error message content for users
- When creating custom error types or exception classes
- When implementing retry logic for transient failures
- When handling file system or database operation errors
- When validating preconditions and failing early
- When implementing graceful degradation for non-critical features
- When ensuring resources are cleaned up in finally blocks
- When logging errors for debugging and monitoring
