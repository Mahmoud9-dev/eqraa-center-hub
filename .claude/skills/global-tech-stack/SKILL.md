name: Global Tech Stack
description: Reference and follow the project's defined technology stack including frameworks, libraries, and tools. Use this skill when choosing technologies, adding dependencies, or ensuring consistency with the established stack. Apply when making decisions about which libraries to use, how to structure code for the framework, or when suggesting technical approaches. Essential for understanding the application framework (Next.js, Rails, Django), frontend technologies (React, Vue, Tailwind), database and ORM choices (PostgreSQL, Prisma), testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright), and deployment infrastructure being used in the project.

## When to use this skill:

- When choosing which library or framework to use for a feature
- When adding new dependencies to package.json or similar
- When structuring code to match framework conventions
- When implementing features using the project's ORM or database
- When writing code that should match the CSS framework in use
- When selecting testing approaches that match the test framework
- When considering deployment and infrastructure constraints
- When integrating with authentication or third-party services
- When reviewing if new dependencies align with the stack
- When making architectural decisions that affect the tech stack
