name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write effective and focused tests that validate core functionality without over-testing during development. Use this skill when writing unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests. Apply when creating test files (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts, __tests__/*), implementing test cases, or deciding what to test. Essential for writing minimal tests during development to maintain velocity, testing only core user flows and critical paths, deferring edge case testing until dedicated testing phases, focusing tests on behavior rather than implementation details, using clear descriptive test names, mocking external dependencies appropriately, and keeping tests fast for frequent execution.
---

## When to use this skill:

- When creating new test files (*.test.ts, *.spec.ts, *.test.js)
- When writing unit tests for functions or classes
- When implementing integration tests for APIs or services
- When creating end-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress
- When deciding which functionality to test vs skip
- When writing test assertions and expectations
- When mocking databases, APIs, or external services
- When naming test cases descriptively
- When organizing tests in describe/it blocks
- When balancing test coverage with development velocity
- When editing files in `__tests__/`, `/tests/`, or `/spec/` directories
