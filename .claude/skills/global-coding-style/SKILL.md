name: Global Coding Style
description: Maintain consistent code style, formatting, and naming conventions across the entire codebase. Use this skill when writing any code to ensure it follows established patterns and conventions. Apply when creating functions, variables, classes, or files in any language (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.). Essential for following consistent naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case), using meaningful and descriptive names, keeping functions small and focused, maintaining consistent indentation, removing dead code and unused imports, following DRY principles by extracting common logic, and avoiding unnecessary backward compatibility code.

## When to use this skill:

- When writing any new code in any programming language
- When naming variables, functions, classes, or files
- When deciding on function size and complexity
- When refactoring code for better readability
- When removing dead code, unused imports, or commented-out blocks
- When extracting common logic into reusable functions
- When formatting code with consistent indentation
- When reviewing code for style consistency
- When choosing between abbreviations vs full descriptive names
- When applying linter or formatter rules
- When avoiding duplication through the DRY principle
