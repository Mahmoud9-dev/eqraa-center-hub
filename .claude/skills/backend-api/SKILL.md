description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following industry best practices. Use this skill when creating API routes, controllers, or endpoint handlers. Apply when working on files like routes.ts, api/*.ts, controllers/*.ts, or any server-side endpoint definitions. Essential for implementing CRUD operations, handling HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), designing URL structures, implementing versioning, setting up query parameters for filtering/sorting/pagination, and returning proper HTTP status codes.
