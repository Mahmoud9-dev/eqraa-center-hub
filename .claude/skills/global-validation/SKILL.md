name: Global Validation
description: Implement comprehensive input validation on both client and server sides to ensure data integrity and security. Use this skill when validating user input, form fields, API request bodies, or any data entering the system. Apply when working on forms, API endpoints, data processing functions, or anywhere user-provided data is handled. Essential for always validating on the server side, using client-side validation for UX feedback, failing early on invalid input, providing specific field-level error messages, using allowlists over blocklists, checking types and formats systematically, sanitizing input to prevent injection attacks, and applying validation consistently across all entry points.

## When to use this skill:

- When implementing form validation on the client side
- When validating API request bodies on the server
- When adding input validation to function parameters
- When sanitizing user input to prevent XSS or injection attacks
- When defining validation schemas (Zod, Yup, Joi)
- When writing custom validation logic for business rules
- When providing user-friendly validation error messages
- When validating data types, formats, and required fields
- When implementing validation at system boundaries
- When checking data ranges and constraints
- When handling validation errors in background jobs
